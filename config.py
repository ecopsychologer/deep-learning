# --- Model Architecture ---
# Number of units in the dense layers of generator and discriminator models
# These control how quickly the generator and discriminator learn. Too high, and they may overshoot optimal solutions; too low, and they may get stuck or learn very slowly.
# If the discriminator learns too fast, it may overfit to the current generator's output and not provide useful gradients. If the generator's learning rate is too low in comparison, it may not catch up, leading to poor image quality.
# These are the number of units in the dense layers of your generator and discriminator models. Increasing these can give the network more capacity to learn complex patterns, but too much complexity can lead to overfitting or longer training times.
